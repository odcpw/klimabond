# Klimabonder
The purpose of Klimabonder is to facilitate the (4,4) strategy for Klima. This should encourage returns beyond the (3,3) and incentivize bonding and capture of BCT into the protocol. By staking your Klima as the bonds vest, you're able to obtain staking rewards in addition to the bond discount, aka (1,1 + 3,3) -> (4,4).

Until OlympusDAO (and eventually KlimaDAO) updates to v2 and its automatic restaking, this is meant to help encourage bonding as a strategy. On Polygon and it's low gas fees, (4,4) can be cost effective.

## Configuration
Install nodejs.

Clone the repository or download the files to a directory.

Install Web3 by running ```npm install web3```.

Edit bondandrestake.js to input your public address and private key. NEVER share the modified file, upload it anywhere, or let anyone see it in screensharing etc. YOU are responsible for this file!

## Todo:
Work with block times to be more precise.

Get bonding rates to unstake, swap and rebond when they are favorable.
